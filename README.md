# FlowerCounter
Java:  First time using arrays
A class is created called "FlowerCounter" that computes the cost of flowers sold at a flower stand. Five kinds of flowers—petunia, pansy, rose, violet, and carnation—are stocked and cost, respectively, 50¢, 75¢, $1.50, 50¢, and 80¢ per flower. An array of strings that holds the names of these flowers is created. Then another array is added that holds the cost of each corresponding flower. The program should read the name of a flower and the quantity desired by a customer. As well ebing able to locate the flower in the name array and use that index to find the cost per item in the cost array. The code will then compute and print the total cost of the sale. The test class does not know any details of the flower shop except that it sells flowers.
